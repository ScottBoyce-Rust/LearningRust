# Scott Boyce Personal Rust Learning

This repository contains Rust code that I either rewrote, completed from learning websites, or derived for myself. All the derived Rust packages are placed in the `src` directory with an additional subdirectory for the origin of the code. The subdirectory will contain the appropriate license for that is required by the original source code. The codes are all from open source licenses (eg, Apache License, Version 2.0, MIT license, and CC0).

The purpose of this project is to deepen my understanding of Rust by implementing and experimenting with the examples provided in their documentation. This code is not meant for any specific use, outside of my personal enrichment in using Rust.
